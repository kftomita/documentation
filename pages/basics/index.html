  <p>PiLR Health is a platform that enables researchers to collect, manage,
and analyze data from mobile health studies. PiLR was developed on the
principles of ease-of-use and extensibility. With just a few clicks,
you can create a fully-functioning project, add a participant, and
begin collecting data from one or more apps, sensors, or other mobile
devices. PiLR handles the tedious tasks of merging data from these
multiple sources.</p>
<p>PiLR is extensible, both in terms of the devices it can collect data
from, and its analysis tools. New devices can be routed through PiLR&#39;s
API, to streamline the data collection process. On the backend, PiLR
is integrated with the R statistical programming language. So it can
generate dashboard summaries while your participants are generating
data, or analyze your data using the power of R. </p>
