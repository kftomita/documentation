PiLR Health is a platform that enables researchers to collect, manage,
and analyze data from mobile health studies. PiLR was developed on the
principles of ease-of-use and extensibility. With just a few clicks,
you can create a fully-functioning project, add a participant, and
begin collecting data from one or more apps, sensors, or other mobile
devices. PiLR handles the tedious tasks of merging data from these
multiple sources.

PiLR is extensible, both in terms of the devices it can collect data
from, and its analysis tools. New devices can be routed through PiLR's
API, to streamline the data collection process. On the backend, PiLR
is integrated with the R statistical programming language. So it can
generate dashboard summaries while your participants are generating
data, or analyze your data using the power of R.
